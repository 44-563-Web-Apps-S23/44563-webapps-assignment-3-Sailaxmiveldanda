        <h4> Favourite Team Sport - Cricket </h4>
        <p> I like Sport Cricket is a team game. Crickters break the records almost in every tournments,
            which is one of the most exciting aspect of the game. I like to watch more <b>T-20 or 
            One-day matches</b> because the excitiment lasts till last ball. Cricket can be enjoyed
             by the whole team and delivers a message of working as a <b>Team and associating 
             with whole team,encouraging the skills of person in action</b> is another reason for liking 
             cricket. If we enjoy suspense, then <b>Cricket is best.</b>

    <h3> Sample Code Snippet </h3>

    <P> Here is question from Stackover flow Website </P>
    <blockquote cite = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9828831/jquery-on-window-resize" 
    You get events you can bind to during the resizing, but also at the end of resizing. You can fake it 
    by setting a timeout to run the code you want to run when resizing stops. 
    Then clear that timeout every time a resize event fires. That way the timeout will only 
    finish if that timeout actually finishes.></blockquote>
