        <h3> Fovourite Book: Surpassing Love and Grace (An offering from his devotees) </h3>
        <p>
            This book ia a compilation of various articles written by <b> Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi </b>
            published in Arshram Magazines The Mountain Path and The Call Divine. The greatness of 
            Sri Ramana Maharshi attracted many devotess from all over the world. Even a photograph 
            of the Maharshi could root them to the spot and the mind would suddenly go blank. 
            Ever will be the Maharshi's inflience upon those who approach with piety and devotion. 
            The book which I read, the devotees will speak of Maharshi in awed tones and with overwhelming
            sensitivity and Love. He lay down on the floor, made his body stiff, and held his breath. 
            "My body is dead now," he said to himself, "but I am still alive." In a flood of spiritual 
            awareness he realized he was spirit, not his body.<br>
            <br>
            I liked the book verymuch because i have come to know how he lived his life in Arunachala.
            He also didn't have human guru(other than himslef). He said that his guru was Arunachala,
            a holy mountain in South India. By reading this book I have learnt a method called Self-inquiry
            in which the seeker foucuses continues attention on the I-thought in order to find its source.
            In the beginning this requires effort, but eventually something deeper than the ego 
            takes over and the mind dissolves in the heart center.
